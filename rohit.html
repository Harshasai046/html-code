    <p>Rohit Gurunath Sharma was born on 30 April 1987 in Bansod, Nagpur, Maharashtra, India.[9] His mother, Purnima
        Sharma, is from Visakhapatnam, Andhra Pradesh.[10] His father, Gurunath Sharma, worked as a caretaker of a
        transport firm storehouse. Sharma was raised by his grandparents and uncles in Borivali because of his father's
        low income. He would visit his parents, who lived in a single-room house in Dombivli, only during weekends.[11]
        He has a younger brother,[12] Vishal Sharma.[citation needed]</p>
    <p>
        Sharma joined a cricket camp in 1999 with his uncle's money. Dinesh Lad, his coach at the camp, asked him to
        change his school to Swami Vivekanand International School, where Lad was the coach and the cricket facilities
        were better than those at Sharma's old school. Sharma recollects, "I told him I couldn't afford it, but he got
        me a scholarship. So for four years I didn't pay a penny, and did well in my cricket".[12] Sharma started as an
        off-spinner who could bat a bit before Lad noticed his batting ability and promoted him from number eight to
        open the innings. He excelled in the Harris and Giles Shield school cricket tournaments, scoring a century on
        debut as an opener.[13]</p>
    <p>
        Rohit Gurunath Sharma is an Indian international cricketer who currently plays for and
        captains the India national cricket team in Test and One Day International (ODI) matches. He formerly captained
        the team in Twenty20 International (T20I) matches until his retirement after India’s win in 2024 ICC Men's T20
        World Cup.[4] The right-handed batsman, who is considered one of the best batsmen of his generation and one of
        the greatest opening batters of all time,[5] is known for his timing, elegance, six-hitting abilities and
        leadership skills.
    </p>
    <p>
        e holds several batting records which famously include most runs in T20 Internationals, most sixes in
        international cricket,[a] most double centuries in ODI cricket (3), most centuries at Cricket World Cups (7) and
        joint most hundreds in Twenty20 Internationals (5). He is the first player to score 5 T20I centuries.[7] He also
        holds the world record for the highest individual score (264) in a One Day International (ODI) match and is the
        only player to have scored three double-centuries in ODIs and also holds the record for scoring most hundreds
        (five) in a single Cricket World Cup, for which he won the ICC Men's ODI Cricketer of the Year award in 2019. He
        is the only player to win 50 matches as captain in T20Is.[8]</p>
    <p>
        He plays for Mumbai Indians and Mumbai cricket team in Indian Premier League (IPL) and domestic cricket
        respectively. He formerly captained Mumbai Indians and the team has won 5 Indian Premier League titles in 2013,
        2015, 2017, 2019 and 2020 under him, making him the most successful captain in IPL history, sharing this record
        with MS Dhoni. With India, Rohit Sharma was a member of the team that won the 2007 T20 World Cup, and the 2013
        ICC Champions Trophy, where he played in the finals of both tournaments. He is also one of two players who have
        played in every edition of the T20 World Cup, from the inaugural edition in 2007 to the latest one in 2024.[b]
        He is the only Indian player to win two T20 World Cups. He became the second Indian captain to win a T20 World
        Cup, when he led India to win the 2024 T20 World Cup.</p>
    <p>
        He has received two national honours, the Arjuna Award in 2015 and the prestigious Major Dhyan Chand Khel Ratna
        Award in 2020 by the Government of India. Under his captaincy, India won the 2018 Asia Cup and the 2023 Asia
        Cup, the seventh and eighth time the country won the title, both in ODI format as well as the 2018 Nidahas
        Trophy, their second overall and first in T20I format.</p>
    <p>
        Outside cricket, Sharma is an active supporter of animal welfare campaigns. He is the official Rhino Ambassador
        for WWF-India and is a member of People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals (PETA). He has worked with PETA in
        its campaign to raise awareness of the plight of homeless cats and dogs in India.

        sharma has been sponsored by several brands including CEAT and the Swiss watchmaker Hublot.[17][18] In his
        career, Sharma has endorsed many other brands including Maggi, Fair and Lovely, Lay's, Nissan, energy drink
        Relentless, Nasivion nasal spray, Aristocrat by VIP Industries, Adidas and Oppo mobiles.[19]
    </p>
    <p>
        Sharma made his List A debut for West Zone against Central Zone in the Deodhar Trophy at Gwalior in March 2005.
        Batting at number eight, he scored 31 not out as West Zone won by 3 wickets with 24 balls remaining. Cheteshwar
        Pujara and Ravindra Jadeja made their debuts in the same match.[20] It was Sharma's unbeaten innings of 142 in
        123 balls against North Zone at the Maharanna Bhupal College Ground in Udaipur in the same tournament that
        brought him into the limelight.[21] He visited Abu Dhabi and Australia with the India A squad and was then
        included among India's 30-member probable's list for the upcoming ICC Champions Trophy tournament, although he
        did not make the final squad.[22]

        Sharma made his first-class debut for India A against New Zealand A at Darwin in July 2006. He scored 57 and 22
        as India won by 3 wickets.[23] He made his Ranji Trophy debut for Mumbai in the 2006–07 season and scored 205
        off 267 balls against Gujarat.[24] Mumbai went on to win the tournament with Sharma scoring a half-century (57)
        in his second innings in the final against Bengal.[25]

        Sharma has spent his entire domestic first-class career at Mumbai. In December 2009, he made his highest career
        score of 309 not out in the Ranji Trophy against Gujarat.[26] In October 2013, upon the retirement of Ajit
        Agarkar, he was appointed team captain ahead of the 2013–14 season.[27]
    </p>
    <h1 id="career_of_rohit">Career</h1>
    <p>
        Test matches
        In November 2013, during Sachin Tendulkar's farewell series, Sharma made his Test debut at Eden Gardens in
        Kolkata against West Indies and scored 177, the second-highest score on debut by an Indian to Shikhar Dhawan
        (187).[28] He followed it up with 111 (not out) in the second Test at his home ground, the Wankhede Stadium in
        Mumbai.[29]

        Having been out of the Test team since 2017–18, Sharma went on the 2018–19 tour of Australia after he had earned
        a recall earlier. Chief selector M. S. K. Prasad said the reason for his recall was that his natural game suited
        the bouncy Australian pitches.[30] Sharma played in the first Test in Adelaide, scoring 37 and 1 in an Indian
        victory.[31][32] During the first Test, he sustained a minor injury which saw him miss the second Test in
        Perth.[33] He recovered for the Boxing Day third Test at Melbourne and scored 63 (not out) to help India total
        443/7 and win both the Test and the series.[34] After the third Test, Sharma had to return to India for the
        birth of his daughter.[35]

        In October 2019, in the third Test against South Africa, Sharma scored his 2,000th run and his first double
        century in Tests. He made 212 in the first innings of the match.[36][37] Sharma was named as vice-captain of
        India's Test team during the tour of Australia in 2020, replacing Cheteshwar Pujara.[38][39][40]
    </p>
    <p>
        Sharma had a successful home series against England in 2021. Instrumental in his team's comeback after a defeat
        in the first Test at Chennai, he scored a century, one that The Guardian termed "deserves to be considered one
        of the greatest this century."[41] He put on 167 runs with Ajinkya Rahane for the fourth wicket while making 161
        runs in an innings that included 18 fours and two sixes.[42] India went on to win the Test by 317 runs.[43] He
        top-scored for his side in both innings of the low-scoring third Test in Ahmedabad with scores of 66 and 25
        contributing to his team's win.[44] Sharma finished the series aggregating 345 runs, the most for India, at an
        average of 58.[41] He went on to score his first overseas Test century on 4 September 2021 with an innings of
        127 against England at The Oval, also reaching the milestone of 3,000 runs in Test cricket.[45]

        Sharma was appointed captain of India's Test team in February 2022, succeeding Virat Kohli, ahead of a two-match
        series against Sri Lanka.[46] Sunil Gavaskar praised his leadership and Chetan Sharma, India's chairman of
        selectors, said: "We will groom future captains under him".[47]

        2015, 2019 and 2023 Cricket World Cups
        Main articles: 2015 Cricket World Cup, 2019 Cricket World Cup, and 2023 Cricket World Cup
        In March 2015, Sharma made his first appearance in the Cricket World Cup and played in eight matches for India
        in the 2015 tournament in Australia. India reached the semi-final stage where they were defeated by Australia.
        Sharma scored 330 runs in the tournament with one century, a score of 137 in the quarter-final against
        Bangladesh.[48]

        On 15 April 2019, Sharma was appointed vice-captain of India's squad for the 2019 World Cup in England.[49] In
        the opening match against South Africa, he scored 122, including his 12,000th run in international
        cricket.[50][51] He followed it up with centuries against Pakistan, England and Bangladesh. In the match against
        Sri Lanka, hitting yet another century, he became the first batsman to score five centuries in a single World
        Cup tournament,[52] and equalled Tendulkar's record for the most centuries (6) in all World Cup matches.[53]
        Sharma totalled 648 runs in the tournament to finish as the leading run-scorer and win the ICC's Golden Bat
        award, the third Indian player to do so.[54]

        On 8 October 2023, during the ICC Cricket World Cup, Sharma was entrusted with the captaincy responsibilities
        for the Indian team in a match against Australia. This significant moment marked the first time he captained the
        Indian side in the Cricket World Cup. What set this particular event apart was that at that time, he had become
        the oldest player to lead the Indian team in the tournament,[55] showcasing his maturity and experience as a
        cricketer.

        On 11 October 2023, during a match against Afghanistan in the Cricket World Cup 2023, Sharma achieved a
        milestone by surpassing the Sachin Tendulkar's record for the most centuries in World Cup history. With a
        display of batting prowess, Sharma notched his seventh century, breaking the record in this World Cup
        encounter.[56]
    </p>
    <p>
        Other one-day international matches
        Sharma made his full international debut in a one-day match against Ireland in Belfast on 23 June 2007. This was
        part of the 2007 Future Cup competition which also involved South Africa. He was number seven in the batting
        order but did not bat as India won the game by 9 wickets.[57]

        He scored his maiden ODI half-century (52) against Pakistan at Jaipur on 18 November 2007 and was selected for
        the Indian squad going to the 2007–08 Commonwealth Bank Series in Australia.[58][59] In that series, he scored
        235 runs at an average of 33.57 with 2 fifties, including 66 in the first final at Sydney when he partnered
        Sachin Tendulkar for most of India's successful run chase.[60][61] After that, however, his ODI performances
        suffered a downturn and he lost his middle-order position to Suresh Raina. Later, Virat Kohli took his position
        as the reserve batsman. In December 2009, following his triple century in the Ranji Trophy, he was recalled to
        the ODI team for the tri-nations tournament in Bangladesh as Tendulkar opted to rest in the series.[62]

        He scored his maiden ODI century (114) against Zimbabwe on 28 May 2010 and followed it up with another century
        in the next match of the tri-series against Sri Lanka on 30 May 2010 by scoring 101 not out.[63][64] He had a
        run of poor form in South Africa just before the 2011 World Cup and as a consequence he was left out of India's
        squad for the tournament.[65]

        Sharma was recalled to the limited-overs squad for the tour of the West Indies in June and July 2011.[66] In the
        first match at Queen's Park Oval, he scored 68 (not out) from 75 balls with three fours and a six. In the third
        match at the Sir Vivian Richards Stadium in Antigua, he scored a match-winning 86 off 91 balls after India had
        been reduced to 92 for 6.[67]

        He had a disastrous loss of form in 2012 and scored only 168 runs in the whole calendar year at the very low
        average of 12.92 with just a single half-century. Even so, his captain Mahendra Singh Dhoni showed faith in him,
        and his career was revived in 2013. Dhoni decided to move him up the batting order to open the innings with
        Shikhar Dhawan in the 2013 ICC Champions Trophy. The pairing was a success and India won the competition,
        defeating hosts England in the final.[68]

        His good form continued and, later in the year against Australia, he scored 141 (not out) in Jaipur. He followed
        that with 209 off 158 balls in Bangalore and established a then-world record for the most sixes (16) in a
        one-day international innings (since beaten by Eoin Morgan of England with 17).[69] On 13 November 2014, playing
        against Sri Lanka at Eden Gardens in Kolkata, Sharma broke the world record for the highest score in a one-day
        international innings with 264 from 173 deliveries.[70][71]

        In December 2017, India's captain Virat Kohli was rested for the series against Sri Lanka, in preparation for
        India's tour to South Africa, which began in the first week of January 2018. In his place, Sharma was appointed
        team captain and India under his leadership won the series 2–1, their eighth consecutive series win since
        defeating Zimbabwe in June 2016.[72][73] Sharma also hit his third ODI double-century in this series, scoring
        208 (not out) to extend his record of most ODI double-centuries by a player.[74]

        In September 2018, in the absence of many top players including regular captain Virat Kohli, Sharma led India to
        win the 2018 Asia Cup, where they defeated Bangladesh in the final.[75]
    </p>
    <p>
        Sharma was included in the Indian squad for the 2007 ICC World Twenty20 and made his mark by scoring an unbeaten
        50 from 40 deliveries against hosts South Africa in the quarter-finals. This enabled India to win the match by
        37 runs and they went on to defeat Pakistan in the final, when Sharma scored 30 (not out) from 16
        deliveries.[82][83]

        On 2 October 2015, during the South African tour of India, Sharma scored 106 in the first Twenty20 international
        at HPCA Stadium in Dharamshala. With that, he became the second Indian cricketer to have scored centuries in all
        three formats of international cricket.[84]

        In December 2017, in a series against Sri Lanka, Sharma scored the joint-fastest T20I century, in 35 balls,
        ending with 118 from 43 deliveries, equaling the record of David Miller. This was also his second century in
        Twenty20 internationals.[85]

        On 8 July 2018, during a series in England, Sharma became the second Indian batsman, after Virat Kohli, to score
        2,000 runs in a Twenty20 international career.[86] He was the fifth batsman worldwide to achieve the feat; the
        others besides Kohli were Brendon McCullum, Martin Guptill and Shoaib Malik.[87] He also scored his third T20I
        century during this series, equaling the then-record for most T20I centuries, held by Colin Munro.[88]

        In March 2018, he led Team India to win the Nidahas Trophy under his captaincy.[75] In November 2018, in a
        series against West Indies, he scored his fourth T20I century, creating a new record for the most centuries by a
        player in T20I cricket.[89]

        In November 2019, in the opening match of the series against Bangladesh, Sharma became the most-capped cricketer
        for India in T20Is, playing in his 99th match.[90] In the next match of the series, he became the first male
        cricketer for India to play in 100 T20Is.[91]

        In November 2020, Sharma was nominated for the ICC Men's T20I Cricketer of the Decade award.[79][80]

        In July 2022, Sharma became the first captain in T20I history to lead their team to 14 consecutive
        victories.[81]

        With his participation in the 2022 T20 World Cup in Australia, Sharma became the only Indian cricketer to have
        played in every edition of the tournament since its inception in 2007.[92]

        On 27 October 2022, Sharma broke the record for most sixes by an Indian batsman in T20 World Cups, previously
        held by Yuvraj Singh, hitting his 34th six against Netherlands at Sydney Cricket Ground.[93][94]
    </p>
    <h1 id="achievements_of_rohit">Achievements</h1>
    <p>
        Sharma clinched the world record for the highest ever individual score in a one-day international match, with a
        remarkable 264 against Sri Lanka at Eden Gardens, Kolkata, on 13 November 2014.[9] He is the only player to have
        scored three double-centuries in this form of international cricket.[117] In January 2020, Sharma was named as
        the ODI Player of the Year by the International Cricket Council (ICC).[118] During the 2019 World Cup, Sharma
        became the only batsman to scored five centuries in a single edition of the Cricket World Cup.[119]

        On 5 October 2019, during a Test match against South Africa, Sharma became the first batsman to score two
        centuries in a match on his first appearance as an opening batsman.[120] In the same series, he broke Shimron
        Hetmyer's record for the highest number of sixes in a Test series.[121]

        On 11 October 2023, Sharma achieved a historic feat during the 2023 Cricket World Cup match against Afghanistan
        team, when he surpassed the record previously held by Chris Gayle for the most international sixes (553).[122]
        His powerful and elegant batting style, coupled with his consistency, allowed him to reach this milestone with
        556 sixes, overtaking Gayle's record.[123]

        On 14 October 2023, Sharma achieved a milestone in the world of cricket by becoming the first Indian to complete
        300 sixes in the 50-overs format.[124] This feat occurred during a highly anticipated India-Pakistan match at
        Narendra Modi Stadium, in front of more than 100,000 enthusiastic fans.[125] The Indian skipper's ability to
        consistently clear the boundary ropes with his powerful and elegant Strokeplay has made him a dynamic force in
        limited-overs cricket. This achievement further solidifies his status as one of India's premier batsmen and a
        cricketing legend.
    </p>
    <p>
        on 22 October 2023, during a thrilling encounter against New Zealand, Rohit Sharma, fondly known as the
        'Hitman,' etched his name in the annals of cricket history. In a remarkable feat, he became the first Indian
        batter to smash 50 One Day International (ODI) sixes in a single calendar year.[126] This incredible display of
        power-hitting is a testament to Rohit's batting prowess and his ability to dominate the limited-overs format.
        With each mighty swing of his bat, Rohit Sharma continues to redefine the boundaries of achievement and
        captivate cricket enthusiasts around the world, solidifying his status as one of the most prolific and
        electrifying batters in the game.

        Rohit Sharma, has the record for the most Player of the Match (PoTM) awards in IPL history. He has 19 PoTM
        awards among all other Indian players like Virat Kohli and MS Dhoni.[127]

        Rohit Sharma became the second Indian captain to win ICC T20 World Cup and third Indian captain to win any ICC
        World Cup (including ODI World Cup) for India [128]
